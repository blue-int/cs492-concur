/// Growable array of `Atomic<T>`.
///
/// This is more complete version of the dynamic sized array from the paper. In the paper, the
/// segment table is an array of arrays (segments) of pointers to the elements. In this
/// implementation, a segment contains the pointers to the elements **or other segments**. In other
/// words, it is a tree that has segments as internal nodes.
///
/// # Example run
///
/// Suppose `SEGMENT_LOGSIZE = 3` (segment size 8).
///
/// When a new `GrowableArray` is created, `root` is initialized with `Atomic::null()`.
///
/// ```text
///                          +----+
///                          |root|
///                          +----+
/// ```
///
/// When you store element `cat` at the index `0b001`, it first initializes a segment.
///
/// ```text
